# Crack-detection-in-bridges
A project based on the understanding  & real world application of transducers to detect anomalies in the vibration of a given structure.
The intensity of the vibrations are then correlated with certain thresholds for emperical detetion of cracks within the structure.

Vibration anomalies are detected using piezoelectric senors which convert changes in pressure on its surface due to the vibrations into electric current.

A mobile application was subsequently built to quantify the results obtained and to serve as a warning service that notifies the concerned authorities about the state of the structure.
